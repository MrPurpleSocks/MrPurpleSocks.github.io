Now, Here is my notice. 

This website is not associated VCS in any way, nor is VCS responsible for any content on this website. My service is to give my personal experience with a class offered by VCS. My experiance may not be the same as other's experiance or the school's opinion on the class. Due to the 2021-2022 school year was during the COVID-19 pandemic, some information may be different from previous and future classes (including, past to 2019-2020 school year, or the 2022-2023 to the future). 

To find official class information please visit your class's moodle site to view your class's sylabus and lesson plans (If available).
